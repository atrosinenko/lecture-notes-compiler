The module `toc` from `lib` rewrites trivial Table of Contents
description explained in the readme file in the form suitable for
processing by utilities working with output formats (such as PDF).

To convert TOC to some specific format one should call `generate_toc`
with the following arguments:
* `input_file_name` -- the name of TOC file in simple format described
  in the readme
* `output_file_name` -- the name of file to write output to
* `entry_writer` -- function to be called on each top-level TOC entry
* `header` -- header of the output file
* `footer` -- footer of the output file

The `entry_writer` should be a function accepting 3 arguments:
* output file (not name)
* current nesting level (0-based)
* TOC subtree

TOC subtree is [page_number, title, subsubtree, subsubtree, ...].
For example:
[1, "Chapter 1",
    [2, "Page 2"],
    [2, "Subchapter 1",
        [3, "Some other caption"]
    ]
]

`generate_toc` calls function given as its `entry_writer` argument
for every **top-level** TOC entry, so it always passes 0 as its second
argument. This argument is supposed to be used by subsequent recursive
`entry_writer` calls.
