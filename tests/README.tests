This directory contains tests for lecture-notes-compiler.

Use "python -m pytest" from the root repo directory to run these tests.

Please note that the tests/ directory should NOT have an __init__.py file inside
(but its subdirectories should). According to pytest rules, modules residing
in the tests/ directory should be imported without specifing the "tests" package
such as:

# correct
import mock.ui
# incorrect
import tests.mock.ui
